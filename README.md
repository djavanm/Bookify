# Bookify

A user friendly app to keep track of Audiobooks that are currently available on iTunes. Each user is able to log in or sign up with a new account(only unique emails). Once you are logged into Bookify, you are able to search for different audiobooks by author/title then favorite anything that peaks your interest. If you are not sure, then you can click on 'Click for details' to view a description about the audiobook. Once you've favorited books, then you can view all of your favorites in 'Show Favorites'. Then you can toggle by genre or remove any already completed books.

## Learning Goals

This was a group project for Mod Three at Turing. The major focus was to further develop our skills utilizing React while learning the new processes of Redux. All while further honing our understanding of network requests with an API and backend. It was extremely important for us to work on our expertise, while focusing on testing as much as possible during the one week project.
